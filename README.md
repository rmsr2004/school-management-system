# school-management-system University 2ºY 2ºS

Develop a server that receives UDP and TCP sockets to simulate a School Management System. TCP client and UDP interfaces were also developed.

TCP clients (students and professors) can create a class, send multicast message to students subscribed in the class, subscribe a class.
UDP clients (admin) can add and remove users and quit the server.
